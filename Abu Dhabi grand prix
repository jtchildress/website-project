<h1>Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</h1>

<body>
<p>
this is the last race of the season this is where the driver championship is decided it came down to three drivers that hasnt happened since 2009 where is was sebastian vettel lewis hamilton and fernado alonso. this time it was lando norris, max verstappen, and oscar paistri.
for the race the reigning champion max verstappen neeeded to win and lando had to be below third place and oscar didnt really have a chance unless both max and lando crashed. the race started and lando lost a position to oscar so now lando was in third and max was in first place it came down to a pit stop where lando came out behind max's teamate yuki tsunoda where the controversial thing happend where yuki tsunoda try to defend from lando norris and lando norris went off track and overtook him. the fia decided that yuki changed directions and lando noris had no choice. lando norris kept his position for the rest of the race and won the world championship by two points</p>
